                My name is Jordan Sickmiller. I like to go camping with my friends, we usually will fish, swim, and have campfires. I also like to play backyard sports with my neighboors such as 2 on 2 football or baseball. My favorite games to play are GTA RP and The Last of Us. I also like to build and upgrade PCs when I can. My neighboors and I also like making our own sports with my favorite being a mix betwen soccer and football. The game is just soccer but using a big yoga ball and you are allowed to tackle the other team.<br><br>

                I was born in <span id="hometown"><strong>Wauseon, Ohio</strong></span> and have lived there ever since. I live less then five minutes away from the Fulton County Fair. I live with my mom, dad and sister. I have two dogs and a cat. I work at the Wauseon Marathon right next to Auto Zone. I've worked there for about three years and have been a manager for about two. I started right after I turned 14 and have been working ever since. I usually get about 20 hours a week.
